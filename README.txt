This is a picture gallery site created using HTML and Sass. It features photos of our trip to the Maryland RenFaire in 2012. There are also links for more information on the Maryland RenFaire on the left of the page.

This is currently a work in progress. I hope to have the links working and the image gallery set up by the end of Friday March 7th, 2014.

Update: Was able to get the gallery set up and working on Sat MArch 8th using jQuery. Working on styling the background of the display area and fixing some lingering problems later this weekend.

Update March 16th, 2014
Was finally able to get the pictures in the gallery and the display to show up on GitHub pages. Ended up being the case for the file extension did not match what was in the index.html code and what was loaded up to GitHub. After fixing the file extensions, the pictures finally show up. Now I just have to fix some of the styling for the display and I believe the site will be as finished as I would like it to be for the moment.
