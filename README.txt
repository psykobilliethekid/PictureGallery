This is a picture gallery site created using HTML and Sass. It features photos of our trip to the Maryland RenFaire in 2012. There are also links for more information on the Maryland RenFaire on the left of the page.

This is currently a work in progress. I hope to have the links working and the image gallery set up by the end of Friday March 7th, 2014.

Update: Was able to get the gallery set up and working on Sat MArch 8th using jQuery. Working on styling the background of the display area and fixing some lingering problems later this weekend.
