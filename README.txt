This is a picture gallery site created using HTML and Sass. It features photos of our trip to the Maryland RenFaire in 2012. There are also links for more information on the Maryland RenFaire on the left of the page.

This is currently a work in progress. I hope to have the links working and the image gallery set up by the end of Friday March 7th, 2014.


March 8th Update:
Was able to get the gallery set up and working on Sat MArch 8th using jQuery. Working on styling the background of the display area and fixing some lingering problems later this weekend.

March 9th Update:
Got the gallery working. Made some style changes to the site but overall it's working. I'll post an updated link later on since I'm having trouble getting the images for the site to show up in github.
